### How do I get set up? ###

* Need a JDK, preferably version 17, along with an IDE. IntellijIdea is the prefered choice and what the project was built with. Also make sure to either have a Maven plugin or Maven installed locally. 
* Clone the repo and open up the project from the top level POM file. Make sure to add the inner project "Serverapp" as a Maven project as well. 
* When running the project, start the serverapp first, then start the actual coffee app.
